📊 **World Life Expectancy Data Cleaning and Exploratory Data Analysis Project**

📌 **Project Overview**

This project analyzes the World Life Expectancy dataset, which contains yearly health and socioeconomic indicators for countries around the world. The dataset includes key metrics such as life expectancy, adult mortality rates, infant deaths, GDP, disease prevalence (Measles, Polio, HIV/AIDS), nutrition indicators, and schooling levels.

The goal of the project is to:

- Clean and prepare the dataset by removing duplicates, handling missing and null values
- Explore global health trends across time
- Identify relationships between economic conditions and life expectancy
- Compare developed vs developing countries
- Uncover insights that explain differences in public health outcomes

By combining data cleaning, exploratory analysis, and SQL-based calculations, this project provides a clearer understanding of the factors that influence life expectancy worldwide.

🧩 **Business Problem**

Global organizations, governments, and healthcare policy groups struggle with:

- uneven access to healthcare resources
- rising mortality rates in developing regions
- limited understanding of what factors most strongly impact life expectancy
- data quality problems that prevent accurate reporting and decision-making

Without reliable analysis, policymakers cannot:

- Target interventions effectively
- Allocate funding efficiently
- Evaluate the impact of health programs
- Prioritize high-risk populations

This project addresses the problem by:

- Cleaning inaccurate or incomplete health records
- Identifying patterns in life expectancy and mortality
- Linking economic indicators (such as GDP and schooling) to health outcomes
- Highlighting disparities between developed and developing nations

These insights help guide data-driven public health strategies and investment decisions.
